# ArcheanScreens
For the game "Archean" â€” this is my personal repository to track my learning experience with screens and XenonCode.

- Requires full game for dashboard interaction.
- Comes with example save in parent folder "worlds". Worlds folder copies into Archean-data/server
- HddCode contains the code from the example save's computer.
