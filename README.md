# ArcheanScreens
For the game "Archean" — no longer updated. Poorly organized and certainly unoptimized. 
This was simply to break me into XenonCode and screens for visualizing information. Now time to move onto better — and cleaner — things.

# Key Features
- Comes with example save in parent folder "worlds". Worlds folder copies into Archean-data/server
- HddCode contains the code from the example save's computer.
