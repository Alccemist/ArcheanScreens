# ArcheanScreens
For the game "Archean" â€” this is my personal repository to track my learning experience with screens and XenonCode.
Please note that much of this is sloppy. Very little of it has tangible value. It has simply been me reading documentation and trying to make interactive or "cool" screens.

- Requires full game for dashboard interaction.
- Comes with example save in parent folder "worlds". Worlds folder copies into Archean-data/server
- HddCode contains the code from the example save's computer.
